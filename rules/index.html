            <h1>Rules of Antitrust Monopoly</h1>
            <p>It's a new world, and regulators are everywhere. As a result, it's up to you to make sure they don't find your monopoly.</p>
            <h2>The Rules</h2>
            <p>The first rule change is that you don't have to charge more for your monopoly. Why wouldn't you? Because when you begin to charge more, regulators will start to come after you. The more you charge, the more likely they are to go after you.</p>
            <p>How do you stay away from Government bureaucrats clamping down on the free market? Easy. Just reshift all of your holdings in a way to deceive any Government investigators as to the nature of your monopoly. Buy holding companies to own your property. Buy holding holding companies to own your holding companies. Buy holding holding holding companies to own your holding holding companies. This will give you back your God-given right to charge what you want. Every new connection of ownership you buy makes it harder for the dirty socialists to find you.</p>
            <p>Of course, these don't come without a price. First, you have to pay money to buy a company. Second, you have to pay to add a new owner to a company. Finally, you have to pay every turn to keep your holdings. Talk about double taxation! So, you'll have to think if you have the money to make the investment to start a monopoly.</p>
            <p>But why go through with this? Well, if regulators find your properties, they'll break up your monopoly! If the regulators tie each one of the properties back to you, they will get rid of all your houses and sell the properties back to the bank.</p>
            <h2>How the site works</h2>
            <p>First, you setup the game. Just click what version of Monopoly you're playing. Then you can change the name, base rent (the rent without a monopoly), or color of the properties. You can also change the cost of everything, the number of players, and then you're all setup.</p>
            <p>Next, once you click start game, add properties from the dropdown menu as the players buy more and more properties. Once you have a monopoly, it will show up with an arrow. Click the arrow once you begin to price it monopolistically, and click the property and set the new rent as you begin to add houses.</p>
            <p>Once you add a property, it will show the probability of each of your properties of being discovered. In order to protect your properties, add companies with the menu button. In order to setup the company structure, click either a company or a property in order to add or sever ownership.</p>
            <h2>Changing the probability</h2>
            <p>There are a few things that determine the probability: first, the rent of the property. The higher the rent, the more likely it is that regulators will find the property. Second, the total length of all the paths between the property and the player. The more ways to connect the player and the property, and the longer the path between the player and the property, the less likely it is that regulators will find you.</p>
            <p>Third, the longer the minimum distance between the property and the player, the less likely it is regulators will discover you. Finally, the lower the probability of the other properties in a monopoly, the less likely the other ones are to be discovered. To protect your properties, use as many holding companies as you can and make all of them as segregated from your player as you can.</p>
            <h2>House Rules</h2>
            <p>If you don't want to use the default rules, there are a few different ways you can make the game different:</p>
            <ul>
                <h3>Different Damages</h3>
                <li><span class="bold">Government transfer</span>: Regulators will randomly assign properties from monopolies to other players.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Government Takeover</span>: Instead of giving the monopoly properties to other players, the Government owns the monopoly and charges everyone rent.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Treble damages</span>: For all of you antitrust wonks out there. Regulators investigate every time someone is charged rent by a monopoly. If they find the monopoly, the owner pays the renter 3x the rent.</li>
            </ul>
